#+TITLE: org-status

Scan an org-mode file(s) for dated paragraphs within a specific period
and list them out - i.e. pull dated status updates out of a set of
files.

Starting with running through a single file, but will eventually
extend to run through all of the ~org-agenda-files~ files.

  property drawer "MODIFIED" property (if that exists) to select text.
+ [X] Investigate how to iterate sections as a tree
+ [X] Extract text for each section
